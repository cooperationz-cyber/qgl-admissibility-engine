This software, the **Quantum Generative Language (QGL) Admissibility Engine**, and the theoretical framework it implements are not merely novel inventions.

They are **computational formalizations and expressions of pre-existing Mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge)**. Specifically, this work derives from and gives functional form to the cosmological principles of:
*   **Te Kore** (The Void) as the foundational void lattice.
*   **The Three Kete** (Baskets of Knowledge) as the 11-dimensional woven universe model with functional hierarchy.
*   **Structural admissibility and boundary inversion** as the dynamic principles of reality.

Use, modification, or distribution of this software constitutes acknowledgment that its foundational ideas originate from this indigenous knowledge system. For the full Statement of Origin, see [LINK TO YOUR FUTURE DOCUMENT].
